# Adventures-of-RoboBoy
My first game I created in Unity.

Adventures of RoboBoy is a 2D game. It starts off as a side-scrolling platformer before switching into a top-down game on level two. 

The game uses an asset package of code, sprites, sounds, etc. assembled by my teacher. Some of the code was modified by me as needed.
